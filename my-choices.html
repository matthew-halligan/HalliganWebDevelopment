<h1>Why we chose our design</h1>
<h2>We wanted a simple and modern design. We looked at some other web agency designs from companies local to us and online and we picked out design choices we liked and integrated them into our own site.</h2>

<h1>Extra Things we did:</h1>
<h2>We added a database to our form so we could have an admin dashboard where we can easily see all messages and reply.</h2>

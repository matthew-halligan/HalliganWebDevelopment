    <p class="how-we-met-content">The three of us met during the summer before our freshmen year at UVM. We were all in a program called SESP where we got to spend a month on campus before classes started so we could all get used to the college life. This is when we all became great friends and found out we were all Computer Science students. We knew from that point on that we'd want to work together in the future, both in school and professionaly and the idea of our company formed. Today we are all in the summer before our junior year at UVM and eager to get out there and build more amazing websites and apps. Check out what we're up to in our blog and check out our current and past projects in the portfolio.  </p>
